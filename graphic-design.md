# Four principles of Graphic Design

- **Contrast**
- **Alignment**
- **Repetition**
- **Proximity**

## Contrast

---

A condition of items being strikingly different from each other normally when they're close to each other.

## Alignment

---

Alignment allows the page to act as a whole unit rather than a ```cumpled``` together look. All elements are put purposely without randomness and have a visual relationship with an additional part on the page.

## Repetition

---

Repetition repeats a various elements in your design in connection to the other elements.

## Proximity

---

Proximity groups things together to show you a connection between the grouped objects
